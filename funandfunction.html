                    <p class="description"> <em>Fun and Function</em> is the core of my central design philosophy, and the result of research conducted for my Master's degree at Massey University. <br><br></p>

                            <p class="caption captionpink">Fun and Function aims to imbue the design process with heart, joy, whimsy, and spontaneity. This does not just relate to the whims of the designer, but the experience of the viewer. It's a framework for deciding when to channel the outside-of-the-box spirit of camp internally, and when to unleash it visually.</p>

                            <p class="caption captionpink">This project uses immanent critique, self-reflexive practice, and scriptotherapy interchangeably to dissect what it means to view and produce design. The business card was chosen as a locus of these design experiments because the form acts as a parallel to the design studio. The compact nature of the card encourages rapid ideation, and provides an opportunity to reframe existing workflow possibilities within these constraints of form.</p>

                            The postmodernist dissolution of binaries such as 'high' and 'low' art cracked open a world of possibility for art and design. Works can be viewed as 'kitsch' without a value judgement being placed on the visual attributes of the piece. Fun and Function explores what it me ans to reframe visual communication design as 'kitsch'. Kitsch concepts explored further in this design research are  honest reflection, sentimentality, superficiality, the blending and contrasting of artificiality and reality, eclectic use of media, and sensual immediacy.</p>

                            Here, camp is employed as a form of immanent critique, utilising devices such as stylistic exaggeration, theatricality, and ironic juxtaposition in order to illuminate possibilities for radical intervention in design workflows. Camp can be understood as internal camp; a way of seeing and interpreting (camping). Camp can also function as external camp; intentional critique which employs devices such as stylistic exaggeration, irony, and artifice. Here, camp was my guiding spirit in four ways: prioritising the designer’s own whimsy and fun; inviting the viewer into the artefact as a site of participation and communication; seeking opportunities for moments of reveal; and remaining emotionally sincere while maintaining an environment of stylistic artifice.</p>
